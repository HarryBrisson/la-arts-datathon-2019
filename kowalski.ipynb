    "As a part of the [2019 LA Arts Datathon](https://artsdatathon.org/), we wanted to explore the interrelatedness of technology and arts programs at Los Angeles high schools.  Specifically, we were participating in a track that sought to provide [data-centered](https://twitter.com/wfumihsu/status/1113544786873438208) insights that communicate the value of arts education to stakeholders like government officials and corporate donors.  We were provided an [Airtable of pre-curated relevant datasets]('https://airtable.com/shrs07X15QZsUbAZX/tblNYcMp3t5fydivI?blocks=hide') to assist us on our journey.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start, we import the [LA County Arts Ed dataset]('https://www.lacountyartsedcollective.org/profiledata_public') and filter to only schools offering grades 9-12."
